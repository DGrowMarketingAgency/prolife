        <p class="contracept-text">
          The aim of contraception is to prevent you from getting pregnant when
          you have sex. We often need to use different forms of contraception at
          different times or stages of our life. It is important to work out
          which stage you are at, understand the options available to you so you
          can take control and choose the one that best suits you.
        </p>
        <h2 class="contracept-heading">SEE HOW WE CAN HELP YOU</h2>
        <p class="contracept-text">
          There are several methods of contraception available ranging from
          daily options to long-term reversible and permanent methods. Each has
          its positive and possible side effects. We’ll help you understand all
          available options so you can confidently choose the one that best
          suits you.
        </p>
        <p class="contracept-text">
          You may have decided you never want children and want to explore
          permanent options. There are three forms of permanent contraception
          available.

              Laparoscopic sterilization: Tubal occlusion
            </button>
            <div class="contracept-content">
              <p>
                This involves laparoscopic placement of a specially designed
                titanium and plastic clip on each fallopian tube, blocking the
                tube and preventing the passage of sperm.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is a very effective form of contraception and can be relied
                on as soon as you have your next period. There is a risk of
                failure 3:1000, higher if the surgery is done soon after
                childbirth, at the same time of termination or in woman younger
                than 30. If a pregnancy does occur, one third are ectopic, that
                is the pregnancy develops in the fallopian tube rather than the
                uterus and may require emergency surgery.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is intended to be permanent but there is a chance of regret
                and change of mind. It may be possible to surgically reconnect
                one or both tubes but there is no guarantee that reconnection
                will be successful and that a pregnancy will result.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is non-hormonal and does not change your menstrual pattern
                but if you have been the OCP before you may notice your periods
                are heavier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Done laparoscopically it has the advantage of investigating
                other problems at the same time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Serious problems due to laproscopic tubal occlusion are rare but
                can occur
              </p>
              <p>
                Major complications (1:1000) : haemorrhage, damage to abdominal
                organs near the surgical sitebowel, bladder, ureter other
                viscera (1:1000), laparotomy (large incision) (1:100), death

              Essure Hysteroscopic tubal occlusion
            </button>
            <div class="contracept-content">
              <p>
                This technique uses a small metal and polyer “plug” that is
                inserted into each fallopian tube, permanently blocking it. No
                incisions are needed because each fallopian tube is accessed
                through the vagina and cervix with a hysteroscopy. The inserts
                do not contain or release any hormones.
                <br /><br />
                The Essure procedure is permanent and cannot be reversed. It is
                very effective with a success rate of over 99%. If you change
                your mind there is no way of unblocking your tubes and IVF will
                be required but the effect of the procedure on IVF or the
                developing fetus is unknown.
                <br /><br />
                There is a 2% chance that the procedure may be abandoned due to
                technical difficulties leaving only one or no tubes blocked.
                This means you will need an alternative procedure for permanent
                contraception.
                <br /><br />
                As it takes time for your body to form a natural barrier around
                the inserts and completely block your fallopian tubes, you must
                use alternative contraception until you get confirmation from
                your doctor. Three months after the procedure you will need an
                x-ray and medical check, if all clear then you can stop
                contraception.
                <br /><br />
                Complications are rare but can occur. There is a small chance of
                uterine or tubal perforation, which may lead to damage of
                internal organs. There is a small chance the devices may move or
                fall out after the procedure. There are two implants left in the
                uterine tubes that may affect future medical care.

              Vasectomy – Birth control for men
            </button>
            <div class="contracept-content">
              <p>
                Vasectomy is a surgical procedure to cut or block the tubes that
                carry sperm from the testicles. After a vasectomy the man must
                have a follow-up test to ensure no sperm are in the seman.
                Whilst vasectomy does have surgical risks, the risks are fewer
                and less serious than for tubal occlusion in women. Reversal is
                possible but its success depends on the mans age and years since
                vasectomy.
