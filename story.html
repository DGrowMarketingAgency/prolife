          More than a clinic and less than a hospital with all facility right
          from Consultation, Scan, Lab and Medicine under one roof. This ensures
          patients getting the scan done at the consultation place itself rather
          than consulting at one place and scanning at different place by
          different person which makes them to spend more time and travel.
